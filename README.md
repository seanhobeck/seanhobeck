# Hi there!
My name is Sean Hobeck, I'm 16 and have been coding for around 6 years with experience in:
- C
- C++
- C# (.NET & Mono)
- Java
- Python3
- Typescript

And some of the languages im currently trying to learn are:
- x86 Assembly (SIMD specifically)
- Rust

I'm more of a low-level developer and like using simpler languages and love working with assembly and more specifically reverse engineering.
