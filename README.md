# Hi, there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“– My name is Sean Hobeck, I'm 18 and have been coding for around 8 years with experience in:
- C
- C++
- x86_64 Assembly
- C# (.NET & Mono) along with some MSIL
- Java
- Python
- Typescript
- Turing

ðŸŒ± I'm currently trying to learn:
- SIMD & Intrinsics

I'm more of a low-level developer and like using simpler languages and love working with assembly, more specifically reverse engineering.
