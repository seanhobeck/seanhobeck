# Hi, im Sean Hobeck
I'm currently in highschool and love working on programming projects in my spare time in class or outside of school.
Some of the languages i mainly work with are:
- C
- C++
- C# (.NET & Mono)
- Java
- Python3
- Typescript

And some of the languages im currently trying to learn are:
- x86 Assembly (SIMD specifically)
- Rust

I'm more of a low-level developer and like using simpler languages and love working with assembly and more specifically reverse engineering.
